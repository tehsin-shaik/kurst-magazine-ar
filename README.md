#AR Marker Experience – WebAR with A-Frame & AR.js
</h1>
<br>
<p>This is a <strong>marker-based WebAR experience</strong> built using <strong>A-Frame</strong> and <strong>AR.js</strong>.</p>

<p>This WebAR project was developed to be integrated into an <strong>interactive magazine experience</strong>. Using marker-based augmented reality (AR), readers can scan printed markers in the magazine using their device’s webcam to bring <strong>3D models</strong>, <strong>animations</strong>, <strong>lighting effects</strong>, and <strong>sound</strong> to life—right from the pages of the magazine. No apps or downloads are needed. Everything runs directly in the browser.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Mushroom House Marker</strong> – A magical mushroom model with a pulsing animation effect.</li>
  <li><strong>Earth Marker</strong> – A rotating 3D Earth with informative climate change messages.</li>
  <li><strong>Drone Marker</strong> – A hovering, spinning drone with a glowing light effect that pulses when visible.</li>
  <li><strong>Hero Marker</strong> – A superhero model that plays background music along with a shockwave effect when the marker is detected.</li>
  <li><strong>Fish Marker (Jumping Whale)</strong> – A whale model that performs a jumping animation from one marker to another using a Bézier curve. The whale faces the direction of movement and disappears at the end of the jump for a natural, interactive effect.</li>
